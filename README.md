### Manager_Interface
Manager use allows authorized users to easily check inventory, see what is running low and reorder quickly and simply.

#### View Inventory
Inventory view offers an easy to read, tabular view of every product in the shop and the product details such as amount in inventory.  From here the user can choose to perform another task which will take them back to the main menu.
